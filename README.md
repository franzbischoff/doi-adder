# doi-adder README

This extension allows the user to easily add citations to a bibtex file from either a DOI or URL. This is still in its alpha testing, so may not work for all journals.

It is heavily based on a feature of the org-ref package for emacs, by Professor John Kitchin, https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref.

## Features

To quickly add to the a reference, open the command pallette (`Ctrl + Shift + p`), run `DOI Add`:
\!\[Enter DOI\]\(screenshots/enter-doi.png\)
enter the DOI or URL,
\!\[Enter Ref\]\(screenshots/enter-ref-location.png\)
then enter the path to the bib file (the extension will create it if it doesn't exist). The extension will the retrieve the citiation if possible, adding it to the bib file:
\!\[Bib File\]\(screenshots/saved-example.png\)
